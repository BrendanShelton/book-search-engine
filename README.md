# react-portfolio


## Description

This book search engine has been refactored so that it uses an Apollo server and GraphQL queries.

## Installation

This application requires node.js. Open the root folder containing "package.json" of the application in a terminal and enter "npm install".

## Usage

To run this locally enter "npm run develop" in the terminal and go to http://localhost:3000/ on a web browser. Enter the title of a book in the search bar and the application will display books with titles containing the words entered. Sign up or login to be able to save books and see the ones which have been saved by clicking on "See Your Books" in the top right of the page.
